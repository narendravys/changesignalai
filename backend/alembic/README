Generic single-database configuration for Alembic.

To generate an initial migration after setting up your database:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head
```

To create a new migration after model changes:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
alembic upgrade head
```

To rollback:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1  # Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade base  # Rollback all migrations
```
